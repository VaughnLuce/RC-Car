# RC-Car
This project involved the design and construction of a remote-controlled (RC) car at 1:32 scale, focusing on electrical integration, microcontroller programming, and compact power management. The goal was to create a functional system capable of steering and motor control using an Xbox controller as a wireless interface.
Hardware and Components
•	Microcontrollers: Arduino Uno (initial testing), ESP-32 (final build)
•	Motor Driver: L298N TB66 (initial testing), Motor Driver (final build)
•	Power Management: Buck converter, capacitors, and flyback diodes
•	Motors: DC motor (driver) and servo motor (steering)
•	Control Interface: Xbox controller via Bluetooth connection
•	Lighting: Functional brake lights and high beams (LEDS)
The final configuration utilized the ESP-32 for its Bluetooth capability and smaller footprint, reducing overall space usage while maintaining functionality.
